    "Bhavy Rajpopat is an Indian tech entrepreneur, software developer and founder based in Veraval, Gujarat. He developed Brancho as an on-demand marketplace that lets users book verified, trusted home services by selecting their preferred time slots — a targeted solution to simplify local service hiring in his region.",
  story: [
    "Frustrated by the lack of trust, verification and accountability in local home services, Bhavy set out to build a platform that could change how people in his region hire professionals. The result was Brancho — an on-demand marketplace where users book verified, trusted services directly by choosing the time slots that suit them.",
    "His venture, BRANCHO IND., earned official registration as an ecosystem innovator under the Startup Gujarat initiative, a state government program that fosters local tech development.",
